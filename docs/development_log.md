### **Task: [Primer log con esta técnica]**
**My Prompt/Question:**
> in a professional development flow using the terminal with Gemini CLI What would be the most   professional way to save the history of inputs and outputs of the conversation with the terminal in such a way that professional documentation is generated, for example for a team that actively participates collaborating in a software project but in this case how would I do it for myself who am learning and generating knowledge through the development of this project
 
**Key Steps & Commands:**
NULL

**Summary & Learnings:**

✦ Excellent question. For a professional workflow, you want a process that is structured, repeatable, and 
  integrated with your development tools. Raw terminal history is noisy and lacks context.

  The most professional approach is to maintain a development log in Markdown, stored within your project 
  and tracked by Git. This creates a searchable, version-controlled history of tasks, solutions, and key 
  learnings.

  Here is a complete workflow for doing this:

  1. Create the Development Log

      First, create a docs directory and a log file within it. This keeps your documentation organized and 
      separate from your source code.

      I will create this file for you now. This command will create a docs directory and an empty 
      development_log.md file inside it.
      ```bash
      mkdir -p docs && touch docs/development_log.md (Create a docs directory and a development log file.)
      ✦ The file docs/development_log.md has been created.
      ```

  2. Use a Consistent Template

      For each task or learning session, add a new entry to docs/development_log.md using a template. This 
      gives your documentation a consistent, professional structure.

      Here is a recommended template. You can copy and paste this into the file for each new entry:

      ### **Task: [A brief, clear title of the goal]**
    
      **My Prompt/Question**
      > The question or prompt I gave to the Gemini CLI. This provides the "why" for the 
        interaction.

      **Key Steps & Commands**

      The most important commands I ran.
      I will only include the final, successful commands, not the errors or dead ends.

      ```shell
      node --version
      npm install
      ```

      **Summary & Learnings**

      *   A bulleted list of the key takeaways.
      *   What did I learn from this interaction?
      *   What was the final outcome?
      *   This helps solidify knowledge for me and would help a teammate understand the context of a code change.

  3. Curate as You Go

      After you solve a problem or learn something new, take a moment to fill out a new entry in your log.

      * Be selective: Don't copy the entire terminal output. Curate it.
      * Focus on the "why": Your initial prompt is the most important piece of context.
      * Record the solution: Save the final, working commands or code snippets.
      * Summarize the learning: This is the most critical step for knowledge generation.

  4. Commit Your Knowledge

      Finally, commit your documentation along with your code. This links your learning directly to the 
      project's history.

      ```bash
      git add docs/development_log.md
      git commit -m "docs: Log session on setting up the project"
      ```

      By following this process, you create a valuable, long-term asset for yourself and any future 
      collaborators. It turns your terminal history from a temporary log into a permanent, structured 
      knowledge base.
